# RestaurantApp

RestaurantApp is a web application that can be used to view and order food from a menu. It enables the users to view the meals from the menu, filter the meals by category, select the meal and view the meal details. Additionally he can select a meal and add it to his shopping cart. The user can make a payment and pay for his order. 

RestaurantApp can be used by employees and delivery men. The employees can view the orders and after preparation mark them as ready for delivery. The delivery men view the prepared meals and the address for delivery and upon delivery they can mark the order as delivered. 

During the development of the project several tests are written. I have written test for the API layer of the backend as well as tests for the servise layer (bussiness logic). 

On the following link you can view a demo of the RestaurantApp where all the functionalities of the application are demonstrated. https://youtu.be/G9Wrj75CpXg
